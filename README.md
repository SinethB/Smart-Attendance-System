# Smart Attendance System

An automated attendance tracking system that uses facial recognition and integrates multiple advanced features like gesture recognition, and emotion analysis. This project is built for real-time performance and scalability, suitable for classrooms or workplaces.

## Features

1. **Face Detection and Recognition**
   - Detects faces and identifies registered users with >95% accuracy.
2. **Gesture Recognition**
   - Interprets gestures for seamless user interaction (e.g., thumbs up, thumbs down).
3. **Emotion Recognition**
   - Analyzes the emotions of recognized users (e.g., Happy, Sad, Neutral).
4. **Face registration**
   - Allows user to face register.
6. **Attendance marking**
   - Automatically logs attendance records in a csv.

```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sinethB/smart-attendance-system.git
   cd smart-attendance-system
   ```
2. Register users:
   ```bash
